When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there are multiple people working on a project, you may not always need their changes for what you are trying to do.  Better to download only what you want to concentrate on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch creates a new set of commits in your local repository that veer off from your master.
Clone makes a copy of a respository that you can edit and add to.
Fork copies a repository to your remote that you can add to without disrupting the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You have something to look at or work on if you are not connected to the internet. And a base to compare to other repositories to see possible changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Saving files and sending them to others through email or a service like dropbox.  It's less complicated to do but doesn't track changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I may want to make changes in a seperate branch if I'm not certain of the changes and perhaps want to see the effect they will have or to show others and allow them to work on the project.  But still protect the original in case I don't like the new changes.
